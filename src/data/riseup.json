This is one of the trickier steps in this activity; you need to already know someone with a Riseup account. When you send email over Riseup, you're sending it through the hands of trusted folks who are part of the movement. It's also encrypted, so even if they were subpeonaed or coerced Riseup wouldn't be able to hand your emails over to the state, just useless data. Finally, when you send emails from Riseup to Riseup, they're extra encrypted. The more folks you know using riseup, the safer your data is.",
